Here you can find the projects which have been written during different courses for Machine Learning

## Table of Contents

### Convolutional Neural Networks

* [Steak Pizza](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/cnn/steak_pizza.ipynb) : In this project which was Udemy's TensorFlow Zero to Mastery course I used different pizza and stake images and then created some models to classify these two foods from each other.

### Reinforcement Learning Projects

* [Blackjack Environment](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/reinforcement-learning/black_jack.ipynb) : In this project I used a simple Policy to create a functions to predict the Q-table and then used Epsilon greedy MC control to find the optimal Policy this environment. (It was one of the assignments of Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning course)

* [Multi Armed Banidt](https://github.com/heispv/projects/tree/master/reinforcement-learning/multi_armed_bandit) : In this Folder I used different methods like [Epsilon greedy](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/reinforcement-learning/multi_armed_bandit/epsilon_greedy.ipynb), [Optimistic initial value](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/reinforcement-learning/multi_armed_bandit/optimistic_initial_value.ipynb) and [UCB1](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/reinforcement-learning/multi_armed_bandit/ucb1.ipynb) to solve the multi armed bandit problem.

* [Frozen Lake - Q Learning](https://github.com/heispv/projects/tree/master/reinforcement-learning/fronezlake_q_learning.py) : In this project I used Q Learning method to solve the Frozen Lake Environments problem.
