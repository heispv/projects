# Projects
Listed below are a number of projects that I have completed as part of my studies in machine learning. These projects showcase my skills and knowledge in this field.

## AI for Medicine

* [Chest X-Ray Medical Diagnosis](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/ai_for_medicine/ai_for_medical_diagnosis/first_week_programming_assignment/C1_W1_Assignment.ipynb) : I constructed a deep learning-based medical diagnosis system for chest X-rays. Utilizing a real-world X-ray dataset, we pre-processed the data and employed transfer learning to fine-tune a DenseNet model for image classification. To evaluate performance, we utilized the AUC metric for the ROC curve and employed GradCAMs technique to visualize the model's decision-making process by generating heatmaps that highlight important regions in the images for pathological condition prediction.

## Convolutional Neural Networks

* [Steak Pizza](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/cnn/steak_pizza.ipynb) : I completed a project in which I utilized TensorFlow to classify pizza and steak images as part of Udemy's Zero to Mastery course. Through this project, I developed and trained a number of models to successfully differentiate between these two types of food

* [MNIST](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/cnn/mnist.ipynb) : As part of my machine learning endeavors, I trained a model to recognize handwritten digits using the well-known MNIST dataset. This project allowed me to gain valuable experience in building and optimizing machine learning models for practical applications.

* [CFAR10](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/cnn/cfar10.ipynb) : I created a model to classify 10 different classes using the widely-used CFAR10 dataset. While the resulting model was fairly simple and did not achieve a satisfactory level of accuracy, I believe that applying transfer learning techniques could potentially improve its performance. This project allowed me to gain valuable experience in building and training machine learning models for image classification tasks.

* [Food101](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/cnn/food101.ipynb) : I completed a project in which I used transfer learning to train a model for food classification using the EfficientNetB0 base model from TensorFlowHub. To reduce training time, I applied mixed precision techniques and only trained the feature extraction layer, without fine-tuning the other layers of the network. The final model achieved an accuracy of 70.6% on our dataset. This project allowed me to gain experience in utilizing transfer learning and mixed precision techniques to improve the performance of machine learning models.

* [Blackjack Environment](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/reinforcement-learning/black_jack.ipynb) : For this project, I employed a straightforward policy to devise functions that predict the Q-table and subsequently utilized Epsilon-greedy Monte Carlo control to determine the optimal policy for the given environment. The project was part of an assignment in Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning course.

* [Multi Armed Banidt](https://github.com/heispv/projects/tree/master/reinforcement-learning/multi_armed_bandit) : In this Folder I used different methods like [Epsilon greedy](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/reinforcement-learning/multi_armed_bandit/epsilon_greedy.ipynb), [Optimistic initial value](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/reinforcement-learning/multi_armed_bandit/optimistic_initial_value.ipynb) and [UCB1](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/reinforcement-learning/multi_armed_bandit/ucb1.ipynb) to solve the multi armed bandit problem.

* [Frozen Lake - Q Learning](https://github.com/heispv/projects/tree/master/reinforcement-learning/fronezlake_q_learning.py) : In addressing the Frozen Lake Environment problem, I leveraged the Q-Learning approach in this project.
