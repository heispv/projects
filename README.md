# Projects
Listed below are a number of projects that I have completed as part of my studies in machine learning. These projects showcase my skills and knowledge in this field.

### Convolutional Neural Networks

* [Steak Pizza](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/cnn/steak_pizza.ipynb) : I completed a project in which I utilized TensorFlow to classify pizza and steak images as part of Udemy's Zero to Mastery course. Through this project, I developed and trained a number of models to successfully differentiate between these two types of food

* [MNIST](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/cnn/mnist.ipynb) : As part of my machine learning endeavors, I trained a model to recognize handwritten digits using the well-known MNIST dataset. This project allowed me to gain valuable experience in building and optimizing machine learning models for practical applications.

* [CFAR10](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/cnn/cfar10.ipynb) : I created a model to classify 10 different classes using the widely-used CFAR10 dataset. While the resulting model was fairly simple and did not achieve a satisfactory level of accuracy, I believe that applying transfer learning techniques could potentially improve its performance. This project allowed me to gain valuable experience in building and training machine learning models for image classification tasks.

* [Food101](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/cnn/food101.ipynb) : I completed a project in which I used transfer learning to train a model for food classification using the EfficientNetB0 base model from TensorFlowHub. To reduce training time, I applied mixed precision techniques and only trained the feature extraction layer, without fine-tuning the other layers of the network. The final model achieved an accuracy of 70.6% on our dataset. This project allowed me to gain experience in utilizing transfer learning and mixed precision techniques to improve the performance of machine learning models.

* [Blackjack Environment](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/reinforcement-learning/black_jack.ipynb) : In this project I used a simple Policy to create a functions to predict the Q-table and then used Epsilon greedy MC control to find the optimal Policy this environment. (It was one of the assignments of Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning course)

* [Multi Armed Banidt](https://github.com/heispv/projects/tree/master/reinforcement-learning/multi_armed_bandit) : In this Folder I used different methods like [Epsilon greedy](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/reinforcement-learning/multi_armed_bandit/epsilon_greedy.ipynb), [Optimistic initial value](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/reinforcement-learning/multi_armed_bandit/optimistic_initial_value.ipynb) and [UCB1](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/reinforcement-learning/multi_armed_bandit/ucb1.ipynb) to solve the multi armed bandit problem.

* [Frozen Lake - Q Learning](https://github.com/heispv/projects/tree/master/reinforcement-learning/fronezlake_q_learning.py) : In this project I used Q Learning method to solve the Frozen Lake Environment problem.
