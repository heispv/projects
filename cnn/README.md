# Convolutional Neural Networks
Here you can check out my Projects which have been written using CNNs

## Table of Contents

* [Steak Pizza](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/cnn/steak_pizza.ipynb) : In this project which was Udemy's TensorFlow Zero to Mastery course I used different pizza and stake images and then created some models to classify these two foods from each other.

* [MNIST](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/cnn/mnist.ipynb) : As any other machine learning engineer one of the datasets which I worked with is MNIST dataset to train a model for handwritten digit recognition, so in this project you can check out the code for this problem.

* [CFAR10](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/cnn/cfar10.ipynb) : CFAR10 is a popular dataset which is being used to train a model which can classify 10 different classes. In this project I created a model to solve this problem. Note that it is a very simple model and so the accuracy is not suitable enough. Transfer Learning can be applied to improve the accuracy.
