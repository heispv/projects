# Reinforcement Learning Projects
Here you can check out my Projects which have been written using Reinforcement Learning methods

## Table of Contents

* [Blackjack Environment](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/reinforcement-learning/black_jack.ipynb) : In this project I used a simple Policy to create a functions to predict the Q-table and then used Epsilon greedy MC control to find the optimal Policy this environment. (It was one of the assignments of Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning course)
* [Multi Armed Banidt](https://github.com/heispv/projects/tree/master/reinforcement-learning/multi_armed_bandit) : In this Folder I used different methods like [Epsilon greedy](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/reinforcement-learning/multi_armed_bandit/epsilon_greedy.ipynb), [Optimistic initial value](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/reinforcement-learning/multi_armed_bandit/optimistic_initial_value.ipynb) and [UCB1](https://github.com/heispv/projects/blob/master/reinforcement-learning/multi_armed_bandit/ucb1.ipynb) to solve the multi armed bandit problem.
